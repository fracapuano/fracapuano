## 🧠 **About me**

- 🎞️ Favourite book: _The Count of Monte Cristo_, A. Dumas
- 🏋🏼 I have practiced almost every sport and eventually got stuck on BJJ's mats.
- 📚 I love science. Seriously. As a full time student I even got into High Power Laser-Driven Plasma Physics (knowing only the best idea in math: Fourier-transform)
- ⚡ Consistent overdoer. The kind of person that consistently overestimates their capabilities. Eventually it all works out tho ;)

Enjoy my repositories! 🚀
